### Datetime Drill
***


 The assignment was to write a script that would tell if office locations for Portland, New York, and London are open or closed based on the current time for that location. The office hours for all locations were assigned 9am to 9pm. 
 
 First I researched daylight saving time. I learned about the Olsen Database that keeps track of daylight savings time for around the world. I learned how to import the python pytz module that uses the Olsen Database. 
 
 Also to test the accuracy with daylight savings time I added a city, Tokyo, because I knew that Japan doesn't observe daylight savings time. Also there are other websites that use the Olsen Database so I cross checked with one of those as well. 
 
 Initially, my code was functional but I had a lot more lines of code than necessary so I edited my code to be more modular. In the final version it is easy to add or delete cities by just changing one line of code.
